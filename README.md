**This project was created as an academic exercise and is ABANDONED. The code contained in this project is in no way ready to be used in a real system, and is merely preserved as an interesting exercise.**

Some useful libraries when programming C.

Planned libraries at the moment are:
 - vector
 - list
 - map
 - string

More will be added as needed/useful.

vector (IN PROGRESS):
  provides a data independent vector implementation; push/pop/remove/get generic methods
  provided; vector automatically resizes by a configurable number of elements when max
  capacity is reached; provided method to resize vector at will; will later provide
  standard search and sort methods;
  
list (NOT STARTED)

map (NOT STARTED)

string (NOT STARTED)
